# Azure Test Suite
The AzureTestSuite is the base test suite for all Azure tests. It provides a common setup and teardown for all tests.

## Machine Setup
There are two required environment variables that must be set before running the tests:
```
export TEST_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=
export TEST_AZURE_LOCATION=
```

# ARM Template Tags

The Marketplace Offer Deployment Manager, aka "MODM" parses the `mainTemplate.json` when its submitted through the SDK client.

## How it works
The tags are placed on the Azure Resources defined in the ARM template's list of `resources`. When the template contents is provided to the SDK, 
MODM will take the template and search through the resources for those tags.

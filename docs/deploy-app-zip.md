# Deploying `app.zip` 

You can deploy the `app.zip` package to either the Azure Service Catalog or the Azure Marketplace via Partner Center. Below are summaries and links to the detailed public documentation for both deployment options.

## 1. Azure Service Catalog

Azure Service Catalog allows organizational users to deploy applications within their Azure subscription without needing to access the full Azure portal. 

**Steps:**
1. Login to your Azure account.
2. Navigate to the Azure Service Catalog.
3. Follow the deployment steps to upload and deploy `app.zip`.

For a detailed guide, refer to the [Azure Service Catalog Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/managed-applications/deploy-marketplace-app-quickstart).

## 2. Azure Marketplace via Partner Center

Azure Marketplace is a platform where publishers can offer their solutions to Azure customers. Deploying to the Marketplace requires you to use the Partner Center.

**Steps:**
1. Login to the [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/).
2. Navigate to the Azure Marketplace dashboard.
3. Follow the steps to package and publish your `app.zip` solution.
